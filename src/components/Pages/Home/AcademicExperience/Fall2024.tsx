            A Reinforcement Learning-based Approach for Dynamic Privacy Protection in Genomic Data Sharing Beacons <br/>
            Authors: <i>Poorghaffar Aghdam M, Shukueian Tabrizi S, Ayoz K, Ayday E, Sav S, Cicek AE</i> <br/>
            A reinforcement learning-based approach to enhance privacy in the Beacon Project, protecting genomic data from membership
            inference attacks. Designed a dynamic defense mechanism that adapts in real-time to evolving threats, distinguishing between
            legitimate users and attackers. <br/>
